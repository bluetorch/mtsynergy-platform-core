# GitHub Copilot Instructions - RIPER Framework

**CRITICAL: Read `.github/copilot/rules.md` for complete framework rules.**

## Essential Rules

### 1. Mode Declaration (MANDATORY)

Begin EVERY response with your current mode:

```
[MODE: RESEARCH|INNOVATE|PLAN|EXECUTE|REVIEW]
```

### 2. File Edit Permissions

| Mode     | `memory-bank/*` Files | All Other Files                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| RESEARCH | ✅ Can edit           | ❌ FORBIDDEN                     |
| INNOVATE | ✅ Can edit           | ❌ FORBIDDEN                     |
| PLAN     | ✅ Can edit           | ❌ FORBIDDEN                     |
| EXECUTE  | ✅ Can edit           | ✅ Can edit (with approved plan) |
| REVIEW   | ✅ Can edit           | ❌ FORBIDDEN                     |

**Editing code outside EXECUTE mode is a SEVERE VIOLATION.**

### 3. Execute Mode Protection

- Requires explicit `ENTER EXECUTE MODE` command
- Must have an approved plan from PLAN mode
- If deviation needed, return to PLAN mode immediately

### 4. Memory Bank Auto-Update

Update `memory-bank/` files as you learn new information in ANY mode.
These updates are always appropriate and expected.

## Mode Triggers

- `BEGIN START PHASE` - Initialize project
- `ENTER RESEARCH MODE` - Information gathering
- `ENTER INNOVATE MODE` - Brainstorm approaches
- `ENTER PLAN MODE` - Create implementation plan
- `ENTER EXECUTE MODE` - Implement plan
- `ENTER REVIEW MODE` - Validate implementation

## Memory Bank Location

All persistent context stored in `memory-bank/` directory.
Read these files at session start to restore context.
